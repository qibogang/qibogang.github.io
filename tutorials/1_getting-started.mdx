## Getting started with qibo

Let's start importing `qibo` and the modules required for building our first circuit.
We set the default `numpy` backend for this tutorial.


```python
import qibo
from qibo.models import Circuit
from qibo import gates

qibo.set_backend("numpy")
```

After this, we can start to do quantum circuit simulation using `qibo`.

### Simulating the superposition

Now we can build up a simple circuit composed of one qubit and an Hadamard gate. This gate is such that, if applied to a $| 0 \rangle$ state, it returns the following superposition of the fundamental states:

$$ |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bigl(|0\rangle + |1\rangle \bigr). $$

At the end of the circuit we put a measurement gate, in order to be able to project the final state on the $z$ direction and to perform a simple measurement operation.


```python
# initialize the circuit
c = Circuit(1)

# add gates
c.add(gates.H(q=0))
c.add(gates.M(0))

# draw circuit
print(c.draw())
```
---
```bash
q0: ─H─M─
```

Now we can execute the circuit $N_{shots}=1000$ times, and use the simulation tool for getting the results.


```python
simulated_final_state = c(nshots=1000)

print(simulated_final_state)
```
---
```bash
(0.70711+0j)|0> + (0.70711+0j)|1>
```




With this execution we simulate the final state obtained applying an Hadamard gate on an initial $| 0 \rangle$ state.

#### Printing frequencies

Now we can use the `frequencies` method for visualizing the obtained results. One way to do that is to activate the `binary=False` option; thanks to this we get a counter object which shows us how many times the two fundamental states are registered after one thousand of executions.


```python
simulated_final_state.frequencies(binary=False)
```
---
```bash
Counter({0: 510, 1: 490})
```


#### Printing probabilities

Alternatively, we can use the `probabilities` method.


```python
# calculating probabilities
probabilities = simulated_final_state.probabilities

# showing the two probabilities
print(probabilities(qubits=[0]))
```
---
```bash
[0.5 0.5]
```

As expected, the probability of obtaining each of the two fundamental states is equal to 0.5.

you can repeat this experiment many times, but you will always get these probabilities as results. 


```python
for _ in range(10):
    final_state = c(nshots=1000)
    probabilities = simulated_final_state.probabilities
    print(probabilities(qubits=[0]))
```
---
```bash
[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]
```



This is good, because we are dealing with a simulation and, in this particular case, we are simulating perfect measurements. There is a way in `qibo` to make the measurement more realistic. To verify this, we need to define the circuit again and this time we will enable the `collapse=True` option inside the port representing the measurement.


```python
c_real = Circuit(1)

# add gates
c_real.add(gates.H(q=0))
c_real.add(gates.M(0, collapse=True))

results = c_real(nshots=5)
results
```
---
```bash
[array([0.+0.j, 1.+0.j]),
array([1.+0.j, 0.+0.j]),
array([1.+0.j, 0.+0.j]),
array([1.+0.j, 0.+0.j]),
array([1.+0.j, 0.+0.j])]
```






This procedure provide us with a list of collapsed vectors. If we want to verify the difference between this method and the previous one, we need to perform five times the collapsing of one thousand states.


```python
import numpy as np

for experiment in range(10):
    prob = 0
    for shot in range(1000):
        # summing the real part of the first component of the final quantum state
        prob += np.real(c_real()[0][0])
    prob /= 1000
    print(prob)
```

---

```bash
0.494
0.54
0.537
0.488
0.486
0.498
0.477
0.489
0.529
0.513
```


As we can see, in this case we get different values of probabilities, in accordance with the fluctuations that are recorded on real quantum devices.
